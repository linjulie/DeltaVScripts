# DeltaVScripts

These scripts are used in DeltaV Live to do SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE and DELETE queries to a Microsoft SQL Server database

All of these scripts are written in typescript since DeltaV Live supports that language.

## Standards
Standards are used in DeltaV Live to hold the SQL query statement, and to execute them in a secure way.
Instead of writing the query in the script the standard containing the query is called.
